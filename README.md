# Facebook Page Post Scraper

This repo is a fork of minimaxir's [Facebook Page Post Scraper](https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper) and is being used for a project for MIT's 6.867 Machine Learning class.


## Usage
Make sure you run this with Python 2.

In order to run, get a user token from [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer). Make sure you select v2.9. You DO NOT need to check any of the permissions. The token only lasts for one hour and a new one will need to be generated.

If you want to replace the tagged names in the comments, set the REPLACE_TAGGED_NAMES boolean at the top of the script to True.

Place the status csv in a folder named 'data'.
